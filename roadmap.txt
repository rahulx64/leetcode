To reach the level where you can solve any LeetCode Hard problem, you don’t just need to solve a fixed number—you need to build intuition, master patterns, and train problem-solving muscles. But here’s a realistic roadmap based on proven strategies:

🔥 Ultimate LeetCode Hard Prep Roadmap
🧠 Phase 1: Foundation (50–70 questions)
✅ Goal: Get comfortable with Mediums & patterns.
📌 Topics:

Arrays & Hashing

Two Pointers

Sliding Window

Stack, Queue

Linked List

Binary Search

Trees, DFS/BFS

Heap/Priority Queue

Backtracking

Recursion

➡️ Solve 5–8 good medium-level problems from each topic.

🧩 Phase 2: Pattern Recognition & Advanced Concepts (70–100 questions)
✅ Goal: Learn patterns used in Hard problems.

📌 Focus on:

DP (Tabulation + Memoization)

Advanced Graphs (Toposort, Union Find, Dijkstra, A*)

Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees

Bitmasking

Trie

Monotonic Stack / Queue

Greedy vs. DP tradeoffs

➡️ Practice 10+ Hard problems by type:

3–5 Hard DP

3–5 Hard Graphs

3–5 Hard Greedy

2–3 Bitmask

2–3 Tricky Math

🧗 Phase 3: Daily Hard Problem Grind (50–100 problems)
✅ Goal: Build comfort with Hard-level thinking

📌 Tips:

Spend 1–2 hours per hard problem

Struggle first (30–40 mins) before seeing solution

Write code from scratch even after reading the editorial

Tag problems by pattern and review weak spots

Use Neetcode, Blind 75 Extended, and Codeforces/AtCoder for extra challenge

🔁 Final Stretch: Master Mode
Solve 5 random LeetCode Hard problems per week

Join contests to think under pressure

Teach others / explain solutions to lock in concepts

📈 Summary
Phase	What to Do	Approx Questions
1	Strong Mediums	50–70
2	Advanced Concepts	70–100
3	Daily Hard Practice	50–100
💡 Total: Around 200–250 quality problems with focused effort can take you from Medium to any Hard-level question with enough time and dedication.
